Layout Grid and Responsive, basic task for MEA


To create responsive layout, first we need to create layers that will fit into current viewing space.
Depending on viewing width, layer green's & orange's row will be adjusted. If viewing width too small, the next layer will be placed under in the next row.
We utilize repeat and autofit into element to make this happens.
